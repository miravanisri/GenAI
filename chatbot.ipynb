At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow. LangGraph illuminates the processes within an AI workflow, allowing full transparency of the agent’s state. By combining these technologies with a set of APIs and tools, LangGraph provides users with a versatile platform for developing AI solutions and workflows including chatbots, state graphs and other agent-based systems. **Nodes**: In LangGraph, nodes represent individual components or agents within an AI workflow. LangGraph uses enhanced decision-making by modeling complex relationships between nodes, which means it uses AI agents to analyze their past actions and feedback.',\n",
